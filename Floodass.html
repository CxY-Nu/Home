    <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <pre class="custom-text">
     Photovoltaic power generation can use sufficient sunshine resources to 
     obtain electricity without the need for additional fuel input. It has the 
     advantages of low operating costs, flexible deployment, and environmental 
     friendliness. In Japan, photovoltaic power generation can not only reduce 
     the high carbon emissions brought by the energy industry but also make up 
     for its lack of resources. However, frequent natural disasters such as 
     typhoons and heavy rainfall have also had an impact on the development of 
     the photovoltaic industry that cannot be ignored.
     
     Currently, Experts and practitioners have tried various methods to 
     identify potential candidates by analyzing indicators such as 
     socio-economic, geographical environment, and hazard factors. Although 
     this method takes into account the risks of natural disasters while 
     considering economic and environmental benefits, it is still relatively 
     vague and it is difficult to accurately and intuitively reflect the 
     exposure and vulnerability levels of these candidates. Enhance，we are 
     trying to adpapt a new method combining the Hydro-dynamics model with GIS 
     sytem, estimated the damage to PV caused by heavy rain.

          In the first period, we collected the all the PV location from the
          official website, and selet all the station with an efficiency higher
          than 1MV, as well as other data like slope and DEM. Then, we
          innovatively proposed the method introducing a hydraulic model to
          analyze flood risks in photovoltaic power plants

    <h1>RRI Model</h1>
    <div class="content-section">
      <p class="custom-text">
        The Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model is a numerical hydraulic tool
        designed to simulate various hydrologic processes, including
        rainfall-runoff dynamics, streamflow discharge, and floodplain
        inundation, in an integrated manner. Furthermore, RRI plays a crucial
        role in assessing future scenarios, such as the impacts of climate
        change. Its compatibility with GIS system further enhances the accuracy
        of simulations, making it a valuable tool for hydrological and
        climate-related studies.<br />
        In this topic, we initially admapt to adopt the maximum precipitation in
        Aichi Prefecture, predicting the damage to the local photovoltaic
        industry and estimate the economic losses.

        RTF is an indicator proposed as the resource occupancy to capacity
        ratio, the most significant feature is to compare the occupancy rate of
        a kind of resource on each person to its whole amount. In this study, we
        are going to use RTF evaluate PV's lose caused by the flood hazard.Then
        we will consider the utilization for Climate model to predict the future
        trend of solar power in Janpan.
