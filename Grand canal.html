    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <pre class="custom-text">
The Grand Canal in Hebei Province has a long history since the Eastern Han Dynasty.
It plays an important role in transportation, local agriculture, flood defense, and landscape. 
However, due to climate change and higher human impact, the flow and water quality have worsened, 
eventually changing it into a seasonal river.

In this study, we analyzed land use changes in the Grand Canal over the past 20 years 
and predicted the land use pattern in 2035 under the environmental protection scenario based 
on relevant policies. We conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of ecosystem service changes in the 
Grand Canal Basin using the InVEST model and classified ecological function zones in 21 districts 
and counties using self-organizing maps.

          <p class="custom-text">
            Land use and land cover types reflect the natural landscape pattern
            and human activity intensity in a local area. Changes in how humans
            use and manage land may lead to changes in land cover, directly
            affecting the ability of ecosystems to provide services and
            products. We divided the land use types in the study area into
            cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, construction
            land, and unused land (mostly swamps). Additionally, we collected
            data on temperature, population, GDP, urban planning, etc., in the
            study area for many years and predicted the future land use pattern
            under the environmental protection scenario through the PLUS
            model.<br />
            *Plus is a CA model combines a rule mining framework based on the
            Land Expansion Analysis Strategy (LEAS) and the CA based on
            multi-type random seeds (CARS) to find the drivers of land expansion
            and landscape change.</br>

    <h1>Water Purification Services</h1>
    <div class="content-section">
    <p class="custom-text">
      Water Purification services refers to the ability of different Land Cover
      to retain the pollution by Vegetation. In this part, we utilized the
      InVEST Model to analyze changes in water purification, as well as the
      ecosystem's value. Moreover, to better understand the mechanism of this
      service and the true contribution of each region, we employed
      Self-Orgnazation-Map(SOM) to divide the 21 areas into several levels.<br>
      The main progress is shown as the right figure. We estimated the Water 
      Purification services of Hebei  Grand Canal Basin, and the service value was
      calculated based on the treatment cost for each ton of pollutants. Then We 
      tried to analyze the TN and TP output and retention of the region separately, 
      and innovatively used SOM to classify the service functions in the study area. 
      This will enable a better study of the relationship between industrial layout 
      and regional ecological environment.
